    <title>Transgender Employee - From Vulnerable to Exploited | Leo Yockey</title>
</head>
<body>
    <main>
        <p>I love working in tech. But being an &quot;other,&quot; there&#39;s always an overwhelming feeling that I need to find safety in an unfamiliar environment. And no, it isn&#39;t always because I&#39;m Black.</p>
<p>I&#39;m transgender, too. Sometimes this makes me more vulnerable than my Blackness does. At least it did at my first tech job.</p>
<p><strong>Backstory</strong>: When I started my first tech job, I had only been on testosterone for about a month, which isn&#39;t really long enough for physical changes to start. But I was still able to &quot;pass&quot; (appear to have been born a cisgender male) in many instances. I figured that as long as I took the lead and referred to myself as a man, people would just take my word for it.</p>
<p>This blog is about how my gender identity was used against me to slow my professional development. We&#39;ll be covering the following:</p>

<p>I was afraid of facing transphobia (and having to explain gender identity to a bunch of cis white men), so any act of friendship from coworkers overjoyed me. This caused a major issue:</p>
<p>I was so focused on the approval of the group that I never thought to consider the character of the individuals.</p>
<p>This was my first tech job and my first time being an actively-transitioning transgender employee. I was new to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and emotionally vulnerable. Imagine going through puberty again, but at the start of a new career.</p>
<p> This all led me to think my coworkers were better friends than they actually were. I never stopped to think about how bad I felt after spending time with them, or how I felt like I had to <em>hide parts of myself</em> in order to be accepted. </p>
<p>It was just a relief to have their acceptance. <strong>I wasn&#39;t sure that I&#39;d get my coworkers&#39; approval at first, but more on that later</strong>. When I finally took a step back, I realized that most of my coworkers weren&#39;t even the kind of people that I wanted to be friends with; we just didn&#39;t have that much in common.</p>
<p>So why did I <em>really</em> want to be friends with my coworkers? Because I started this job on the defensive thanks to some mishandling by HR. I was in survival mode.</p>
<h3 id="hr-s-mishandling-a-id-hr-">HR&#39;s Mishandling <a id="hr" /></h3>
<p>Soon after starting, my manager &quot;Steve&quot; told me that the entire team already knew that I was transgender...because the HR Department had told them so. This news horrified me. I had specifically asked the HR Department to use discretion regarding my transgender status.</p>
<p>They failed. </p>
<p>As a new employee, I felt it was imperative that I controlled the narrative. After all, this was my <em>career</em>.</p>
<p>If something about my identity could jeopardize my career, I need to have total control over how, when, and why that information is released to coworkers.</p>
<p>That control was deliberately taken from me.</p>
<p>Anyway, Steve postured himself to be an ally, which meant a lot to me at the time. He told me that I needed to stick with him because other people were likely to discriminate. In fact, he reported that he had already heard employees talking behind my back. <strong>Remember when I said that I wasn’t sure if I would get my coworkers’ approval? This was why</strong>.</p>
<p>To recap: as if we were in high school, Steve told me that some of the other employees on the team didn&#39;t like that I was transgender. How was I to work in an environment like that?!</p>
<h3 id="steve-s-opportunity-a-id-tommy-">Steve&#39;s Opportunity <a id="tommy" /></h3>
<p>Steve immediately isolated me from the rest of the team so that I would be dependent on him. This caused me to believe that his approval would be more important than my work performance when it came to my employment, and I really needed to keep this job. The tech industry is competitive; it could be irrecoverable if I was fired from my first job. I&#39;d need him to vouch for me until I had enough time at the company to find another job more easily.</p>
<p>Just like that, less than 90 days into my new career, something other than my skill set was determining the fate of my employment.</p>
<p>Before I even had a chance to prove what kind of employee I could be, I was (allegedly) already discounted by some. </p>
<p>To make it even worse, Steve gave me little feedback on my job performance. When I requested feedback on my work, he would say that I was &quot;doing great&quot; without any further guidance. I spent less time focusing on how to be the best engineer I could be, because it was becoming less and less relevant to my employment status. </p>
<p>Instead, I focused on being &quot;one of the guys&quot; as much as possible. I had to.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>I focused on being &quot;one of the guys&quot; so much that I forgot to notice that I was the only Black guy</strong>. This proved to be a critical error, because I was also experiencing organizational racism. Yay, intersectionality!</p>
<p>Eventually, every single one of my coworkers initiated conversations that made it obvious they didn&#39;t have a problem with me being transgender. When I no longer needed Steve&#39;s personal approval, I realized that being vulnerable had also caused me to be exploited in another way. Steve had been using me as his personal assistant—or, rather, his spy.</p>
<h3 id="spy-in-disguise-a-id-spy-">Spy in Disguise <a id="spy" /></h3>
<p>In <em>Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance</em>, President Obama relayed a lesson he learned from his step-father, Lolo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can’t be strong, be clever and make peace with someone who’s strong. But always better to be strong yourself. Always.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was raised similarly. I have a strong work ethic, and I work especially hard when I feel like someone put their neck on the line for me. Because Steve had convinced me that he was the <em>only</em> one looking out for me, and because the power dynamics of our workplace made him the &quot;strong&quot; one by default, I felt obligated to him. </p>
<p>So that&#39;s why, when asked, I agreed to be Steve&#39;s &quot;spy,&quot; for lack of a better term. If one of my coworkers was upset or underperforming, instead of dealing with that employee directly, Steve would ask me to find out what was wrong with them.</p>
<p>Being the only transgender employee in a team full of tech bros made it hard to relate at times, but I was still expected to be the one to improve team morale in Steve&#39;s absence.</p>
<p>If my lead had a bad attitude, it was <em>my</em> job to determine the cause and report back to Steve. If my other coworker was thinking about quitting, I was to inform Steve so that then (and only then) would he be offered a well-deserved raise. I told myself that I did this to better my chances at a promotion, but I didn&#39;t. </p>
<p>My actions were fear-driven. </p>
<p>I was fearful that being the only transgender employee meant that my job was more vulnerable, because that was exactly what I was told when I started. Labor laws provide a way to fight back if something happens, but I didn&#39;t want a lawsuit; I just needed to pay the bills. Doing Steve&#39;s bidding when asked felt like the only way that I could guarantee that my job would be safe.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t going to let my own workload suffer because of these extra tasks. I knew that my work performance still mattered a great deal. In addition to increasingly serving as Steve&#39;s personal assistant, I was still doing all of my own work. I was exploited to the point where my work ethic established a stricter precedent for me than that of my coworkers. </p>
<p>It should be noted that I was promised to be rewarded for these efforts, but <a href="./black-in-tech-pay-disparity.html">that never materialized</a>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-a-id-conclusion-">Conclusion <a id="conclusion" /></h3>
<p>Despite pretending to protect me, it was Steve who had been discriminating against me all along.  <strong>He used my gender identity to lie to me and keep me separated from the group, then used that separation to his advantage</strong>. Leaving that job was one of the greatest decisions I ever made.</p>
<p>While I should have been more careful, I can&#39;t blame myself too harshly. It was never my responsibility to ensure that my working environment was free of abuse.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I wrote this blog was so that I wouldn&#39;t be able to hide anymore. Unlike being Black, being transgender isn&#39;t immediately obvious to people when they meet me. This causes a lot of anxiety, trying to determine if it would be dangerous for me to come out (all while still trying to learn a new job). If someone doesn&#39;t want a transgender employee, they&#39;re unlikely to call me if they see this—it&#39;s a win-win!</p>
<p>I control the narrative now.</p>
