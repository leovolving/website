    <title>5 Advantages of Telecommuting | Leo Yockey</title>

    <main>
        <p><strong>Telecommuting has more advantages than disadvantages</strong>.</p>
<p>I had been working from home (WFH) for 9 months by the time the world was starting to practice social distancing. If you consider the cheaper overhead and increased talent pool, it&#39;s clear that telecommuting has many advantages for employers. There&#39;s just one problem:</p>
<p>...honestly, I don&#39;t care if my employer is saving money. I need to know what&#39;s in it for me.</p>
<p>Change leads to uncertainty. Even when that change is good, that uncertainty can lead to resistance. But <strong>there is nothing to fear, working from home is great for employees</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are 5 advantages of telecommuting:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#focus">Focused Productivity</a></li>
<li><a href="#flexibility">Flexibility</a></li>
<li><a href="#opp">More Opportunities</a></li>
<li><a href="#safer">Safer For Underrepresented People</a></li>
<li><a href="#anywhere">You Can Work From <em>Anywhere</em></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s explore each one in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="1-focused-productivity-a-id-focus-">1. Focused Productivity <a id="focus" /></h3>
<p>Is the average workday <em>really</em> 8 hours a day?</p>
<p><em>...Are you sure?</em></p>
<p>No, not if you&#39;re honest with yourself! <strong>Many employees are productive for less than <a href="https://www.vouchercloud.com/resources/office-worker-productivity">3 hours a day</a></strong> on average, with many of the distractions coming from their own coworkers.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, <strong>I actually found it <em>eaiser</em> to stay productive when I started telecommuting</strong>. There are fewer opportunities for distractions, such as &quot;water cooler chat.&quot; As a result, <strong>I am able to complete my work much quicker</strong>. That&#39;s a big deal if your employer values the quality of your work over the quantity. And that&#39;s not all.</p>
<p><strong>You know those meetings that <em>probably</em> could have just been <em>emails</em></strong>? Well, now they can be! An underappreciated advantage is that written communication is used more in telecommuting environments.</p>
<h3 id="2-flexibility-a-id-flexibility-">2. Flexibility <a id="flexibility" /></h3>
<p>The flexibility alone is worth telecommuting.</p>
<p><strong>If you work from home, you will probably find that you don’t have to take time off of work</strong> to run important errands. It&#39;s much easier to do things like lunch-time workouts from home than an office, or trying to fit them in after business hours. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, the flexibility of working from home even improved my social life!</p>
<p><strong>The decrease in social contact at work motivated me to make more efforts to see my friends and family when I&#39;m not working (albeit virtually for now)</strong>. I&#39;m left with a stronger desire for human interaction at the end of the day because I haven’t spent that energy on idle break room conversations.</p>
<p>It’s true that some days can be a little boring and quiet - but that can happen in an office too! It’s important not to let a couple of bad days detract from the overall advantage of telecommuting.</p>
<h3 id="3-more-opportunities-a-id-opp-">3. More Opportunities <a id="opp" /></h3>
<p>I mentioned earlier that increasing the talent pool is an advantage for employers. But don&#39;t worry, <strong>it&#39;s a mutually beneficial advantage</strong>.</p>
<p>I ended up working for a company based in Nashville, Tennessee while living in Los Angeles. Had this company only been looking for local candidates, <strong>I would have never had the opportunity to be considered for this job</strong>. If you&#39;re unable to relocate, <strong>you&#39;re stuck with whatever jobs are available in your city, unless you telecommute</strong>. It&#39;s hard for some people to be sympathetic towards someone whose city already has a large concentration of tech jobs (like me in Los Angeles) but that&#39;s exactly my point!</p>
<p>Only a small handful of American cities have seen growth in new tech jobs.</p>
<p>Many Americans are <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/3/21158932/tech-job-growth-consolidation-brookings-cities-metros-digital-services">missing out on opportunities</a> every single day. <strong>Telecommuting evens the playing field and progresses us one step closer to <em>truly</em> equal opportunity in America</strong>. Allowing employer to live anywhere will help make companies more diverse, which brings me to my next point.</p>
<h3 id="4-safer-for-underrepresented-people-a-id-safer-">4. Safer For Underrepresented People <a id="safer" /></h3>
<p><strong>I&#39;m black, transgender, <em>and</em> biracial.</strong> I almost had to quit the industry.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have worked with a lot of great people, but <strong>I&#39;ve also had experiences so toxic that I had to recover from physical and psychological damage</strong>. In any given work space, I can never be certain if I&#39;m being judged for something other than my work. If that ever does happen though, I know that I&#39;ll be monitored excessively.</p>
<p><strong><em>It&#39;s impossible to do your best work when you&#39;re constantly worried about discrimination and hostility.</em></strong></p>
<p>Another important point to consider is that <strong>the risk of discrimination is compounded with each marginalized community to which a person belongs</strong>. For example, a disabled person of color (POC) is more likely to experience discrimination than me as an able-bodied POC. This is commonly referred to as <strong>intersectionality</strong>.</p>
<p>One of the most important advantages of telecommuting is the decreased risk of workplace discrimination. Anyone who&#39;s experienced it knows what a game-changer this is.</p>
<p>Telecommuting drastically reduces the amount of time that coworkers must interact with each other which means that <strong>employees are empowered to do their best work in an environment that is healthy for them</strong>. Fun Fact: Employees are more qualified than their employer to determine what is a healthy environment for them, which brings me to the final advantage of telecommuting.</p>
<h3 id="5-you-can-work-from-anywhere-a-id-anywhere-">5. You Can Work From <em>Anywhere</em> <a id="anywhere" /></h3>
<p>Ultimately, telecommuting is usually cheaper for employers and employees alike.</p>
<p><strong>If you are hired for a telecommuting position, employers must provide you with computers, monitors, keyboards, and other home office equipment that is necessary for your job</strong>. Where you decide to set up that office is entirely up to you, and it can change as your needs do.</p>
<p>However, no one said that you <em>have</em> to be at home when you work from home.</p>
<p>Because I&#39;m able to stretch out my vacation days, <strong>I take more vacations while telecommuting</strong>. When I travel, I always try to work a few days from my hotel room to save a couple of vacation days. When my work day ends, I can head out to do some exploring. There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad">&quot;digital nomads&quot;</a> who work while spending most of their time traveling.</p>
<h4 id="but-what-if-you-don-t-want-work-at-home-or-on-the-road-">But what if you don&#39;t want work at home or on the road?</h4>
<p>If you&#39;re worried that you may need more separation between work and home, don&#39;t. Employers can provide stipends for telecommuters to use for coworking spaces, which are a nice alternative to the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-much-your-company-pays-to-rent-office-space-2015-05-27">high cost of leasing office space</a>. <strong>You can also look into tax write-offs for any out-of-pocket expenses that accumulate for your home office</strong> (including rent/mortgage and utilities).</p>
<p>...You&#39;ll need to ask an accountant if you have questions about that last one. Taxes are hard!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, I&#39;m a huge proponent of telecommuting. </p>
<p><strong>The world has changed around us</strong>. The 40-hour workweek was once considered to be a fair balance between work and leisure for employees. I’d argue that <strong>it’s time to re-evaluate that equation and allow technology to do what it was built to do: improve the lives of humankind</strong>.</p>
