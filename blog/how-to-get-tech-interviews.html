    <title>How to Get Interviews As a Self-Taught (or Bootcamp) Developer | Leo Yockey</title>
</head>
<body>
    <main>
        <p>The worst thing about becoming a professional developer is exactly that: <em>becoming</em> a professional developer. The first job is the hardest to get. </p>
<p>I, for one, had to do a lot of things just to stand out from the crowd. I followed a strict system that was instrumental in me getting interviews. This system was the application of advice from career counselors, friends, and helpful articles.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I&#39;ll explain the major components of that system. We&#39;ll be covering the following:</p>

<h3 id="this-article-s-definition-of-self-taught-a-id-def-">This Article&#39;s Definition of Self-Taught <a id="def" /></h3>
<p>I will be using “self-taught” as an umbrella term for any developers who do not have a college degree in Computer Science or related areas of study.</p>
<p>That includes bootcamp graduates, like me.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-interviews-a-id-acct-">How to Get Interviews <a id="acct" /></h3>
<p>There are many things within your control that can increase your chances of getting an interview.</p>
<h4 id="keep-track-of-your-prospects-a-id-track-">Keep Track of Your Prospects <a id="track" /></h4>
<p>If you keep track of all of your job prospects from the beginning, it&#39;ll be much easier to ensure you&#39;re maximizing your chances with each application. Especially if you&#39;re job-hunting full-time—you could easily find yourself with 50+ companies to track!</p>
<p>Which job openings still need cover letters written? Which companies are waiting for you to return a take-home test? </p>
<p>Tracking everything in a spreadsheet makes it much easier to remember everything. Speaking of writing...</p>
<h4 id="when-in-doubt-write-it-out-a-id-write-">When In Doubt, Write it Out <a id="write" /></h4>
<p>If you have no one that you can practice interview questions with, consider writing them out essay-style. </p>
<p>Find and read a technical article. See if you can explain it in your own words, pretend someone with less experience than you is asking; how would you explain it to them so that they would be able to apply it in their next project?</p>
<p>If you write these often, maybe you can start your own blog! </p>
<p>Posting original content is one of the best way to improve your chances of getting a job. Plus, it can become an additional source of income!</p>
<p>Just be sure to be open to constructive criticism, if you’re discussing concepts that you haven’t understood for very long yourself. </p>
<p>As a self-taught developer, your own writing can be an opportunity to learn more!</p>
<h4 id="do-all-the-linkedin-things-a-id-linkedin-">Do All the LinkedIn Things <a id="linkedin" /></h4>
<p>As a self-taught developer, your resume may seem less impressive than that of someone with a CS degree (and the internships that usually come with them). </p>
<p>LinkedIn can help fill that gap. </p>
<p>Here are some specific steps that can be taken to increase your LinkedIn engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have anything to promote, it may be a good idea to cross-post it on LinkedIn for the extra engagement.</li>
<li>&quot;Connect&quot; with everyone you can. <ul>
<li>The bigger your network, the easier it will be to find people. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get your peers (personal friends, bootcamp classmates, etc) to “endorse” your skills, and return the favor for them. <ul>
<li>Again, this is something you can do for free that will make you appear more hirable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you worked one-on-one with any mentors, or pair-programmed with a more senior dev on OSS, ask them to write a &quot;testimonial&quot; on your LinkedIn profile. </li>
</ul>
<p>I applied all of this advice myself. All of them increased the amount of page views I received.</p>
<h4 id="have-your-elevator-pitch-and-phone-interview-skills-ready-a-id-ready-">Have Your Elevator Pitch and Phone Interview Skills Ready <a id="ready" /></h4>
<p>If you provide your phone number, some people will call you immediately. </p>
<p>Now you know and you won&#39;t be surprised the first time it happens, like I was...</p>
<p>Be sure to have your elevator pitch ready if you receive a call from an HR rep or other non-tech employee. Be prepared for a couple of phone interview quiz questions if the call comes from a tech-focused employee. </p>
<p>This phone call will probably be short compared to the actual interview, but it can be important nonetheless. </p>
<p><strong>All of these steps are about improving the number of <em>opportunities</em> you get</strong>. It&#39;s your job to be ready when the opportunities arrive. </p>
<p>Remember, many hiring managers feel that self-taught developers have more to &quot;prove&quot; during the hiring process. Fumbling the initial call could keep you from getting the interview at all! Preparation is key.</p>
<h4 id="communication-a-id-communication-">Communication <a id="communication" /></h4>
<p>For <em>every</em> application you send, you must communicate with a real person.</p>
<p>I found that this was the most important step. For the first couple of weeks, I didn&#39;t do this. I didn&#39;t want to disturb people.</p>
<p>That was a mistake.</p>
<p>Frustrated that I hadn&#39;t gotten any calls yet, I finally started sending emails to potential employers as soon as I had applied. That&#39;s when I learned something that shocked me:</p>
<p>LinkedIn sends you a notification when a company has viewed your application!</p>
<p>I received a notification that my application had been viewed about 10 minutes after I sent my first email! I had never gotten a notification like this before. <strong>This meant that none of the applications I&#39;d sent in the prior two weeks had even been <em>viewed</em></strong>.</p>
<p>This is where a big network comes in handy. The bigger your network, the easier it&#39;ll be to find a way to contact the company to which you just applied.</p>
<p>This is probably the most important of all the steps. For <em>every</em> application you send, you must communicate with a real person.</p>
<h4 id="schedule-a-id-schedule-">Schedule <a id="schedule" /></h4>
<p>The easiest way to stay accountable is to keep a schedule.</p>
<p>I created this <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_kqdbaalakk2vbqq7e6fek0ucss%40group.calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> as a template. It can be modified to reduced hours if you’re working full time, or adjusted to accommodate interviews and networking events. </p>
<p>It’s similar to the schedule that I still follow today, just replacing some of the job-hunting tasks with work. Let&#39;s go over some of the sections.</p>
<h5 id="self-care-a-id-care-">Self Care <a id="care" /></h5>
<p>First things first: personal health.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll notice that there are some self-care routines in the calendar. Keep them. Burnout can happen when you&#39;re looking for a job. Especially in a tough job market.</p>
<p>Being a self-taught developer comes with a lot of imposter syndrome. Don&#39;t let those feelings interfere with your health. You will thank yourself later, especially if you become a freelancer.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Regarding the meditation/reading at the beginning of the day. I&#39;ve found it helpful to start my day with meditation and some inspiring reading. You can replace the exact self-care tasks with something more suitable to you. Just  make sure you do <em>something</em>.</p>
<h5 id="prospecting">Prospecting</h5>
<p>This is where you&#39;ll do most of the job-hunting you&#39;ve already been doing. Use this time to find new jobs to apply to and find points of contact within each company.</p>
<h5 id="social-media-engagement">Social Media Engagement</h5>
<p>Twitter and LinkedIn are great places for social media engagement as a dev.  But consistency is important.</p>
<p>This engagement serves as a way of improving your network. <strong>Your network is your most valuable resource as a self-taught developer</strong>. These are the Real Human Beings that are going to support you in your career.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure to use LinkedIn at the very least. Use others at your own discretion.</p>
<h5 id="apply-first-emails">Apply/First Emails</h5>
<p>This is separate from prospecting, where you <em>find</em> interesting jobs. Once you have a list of jobs you want to apply to, it&#39;s time to actually <em>apply</em>.</p>
<p>Use this time to submit applications, write cover letters, and communicate with someone from the company.</p>
<h5 id="follow-up-emails">Follow Up Emails</h5>
<p>The is the time to send thank you emails, requests for informational interviews, and other follow up emails to help build up your network.</p>
<h5 id="skill-building">Skill-Building</h5>
<p>This time block is vague and open-ended on purpose. As a self-taught developer, you know your strengths and weaknesses, and what you need to do to improve your interview skills.</p>
<p>Skill-building activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming books</li>
<li>Code challenge sites such as <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a></li>
<li>Mock interviews</li>
<li>White board practice</li>
<li>A new dev project</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s amazing how quickly skills can start to get rusty. Dedicating time to keeping your skills sharp is an important step in preparing for interviews, and the workplace beyond.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-a-id-conclusion-">Conclusion <a id="conclusion" /></h3>
<p>While looking for your first job, there are many other important things to consider, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company selection - knowing where to apply</li>
<li>Resume tips that sell your skills</li>
<li>Best methods of contact with potential employers</li>
<li>How to work your network to your advantage</li>
<li>Warning signs of a toxic employer</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these topics can (and probably will) be future blog posts. But I cannot overstate the importance of getting into a routine.</p>
<p>I used a version of this schedule consistently 4-5 days a week for 4 months. It resulted in about 300 applications, 20 phone interviews, 5-10 in-person (or video) interviews, and 1 offer. </p>
<p>These numbers are considered normal.</p>
<p>It is unclear if I would have ever gotten a job in the tech industry if I hadn&#39;t followed these steps. I got the 1 job offer from a company where I emailed the Talent Manager directly.</p>
<p>Is this...<em>hazing</em>?</p>
<p>For an industry that supposedly has a talent shortage, it feels like I had to do a lot of showboating <em>just to get an interview</em>.</p>
<p>This was easy to do as a single, childless twenty-something. But what if I wasn&#39;t?</p>
