        <p>2020, amirite?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to talk about how bad 2020 is. We already know.</p>
<p>I want to talk about the fact that I couldn&#39;t stop doomscrolling, but now I can.</p>
<p>My anxiety peaked the first week of June. Since then, it&#39;s steadily getting better. I want to share what I did because I think it will help others.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-doomscrolling-a-id-def-">What is Doomscrolling? <a id="def" /></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Doomscrolling is the act of compulsively consuming media (news, social media posts, etc) to the point that it affects your mental or physical health.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve all done it.</p>
<p>As volatile as things are right now, obsessively scrolling on your phone won&#39;t help. Let&#39;s explore how to stop.</p>
<h3 id="social-media-a-id-social-">Social Media <a id="social" /></h3>
<p>Social Media. You knew it was coming. Let&#39;s get it done and over with.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I don’t use much social media, so I can only share what I’ve done. Hopefully this will give you some ideas you can apply to other platforms. </p>
<h4 id="turn-off-notifications-a-id-notifications-">Turn Off Notifications <a id="notifications" /></h4>
<p>If you’re viewing a lot of stressful content because people are tagging you and sending you DMs, cut the communication line.</p>
<p>I learned something from taking multiple breaks from social media:</p>
<p>You don&#39;t need social media to stay connected to the people who truly matter.</p>
<p>I disabled all social media notifications. I realized that I was spending a lot more time on social media when I was responding to every notification I received.</p>
<p>With notifications disabled, I decide when I use social media. The meme my friend sent me will be just as funny in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Note that this has nothing to do with <em>how much time</em> you spend on social media. Use it as much as you want. Just have some autonomy in <em>when</em> you use it.</p>
<h4 id="change-twitter-trending-location-a-id-twitter-location-">Change Twitter Trending Location <a id="twitter-location" /></h4>
<p>The “What’s Happening” (trending topics) section is the hardest part of Twitter for me. It entraps me with hashtags I can’t help but click.</p>
<p>I found that it wasn’t enough to turn off my location-specific settings. I had to <em>explicitly set a new location</em> that would have calmer topics.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently using Tanzania, the country of my people. The <a href="https://shannonsketches.myportfolio.com/">friend</a> from whom I got the idea was using Finland.</p>
<p>The key is to use a country that won’t have many users. These countries won’t have many trending topics. Sometimes, there won’t be any trending topics!</p>
<p><img src="../pics/doomscrolling-0.PNG" alt="screenshot of &quot;Explore settings&quot; in the Twitter iOS app. &quot;Show Content in your current location&quot; setting is disabled; &quot;Explore locations&quot; setting is set to Tanzania."></p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: some words and topics will still slip through the cracks. Be sure to <em>mute</em> words if you want to guarantee that you won’t see them!</p>
<h4 id="remove-the-app-a-id-remove-">Remove the App <a id="remove" /></h4>
<p>Sometimes, the only way to mitigate stress from doomscrolling is to eliminate the opportunity. Take a break from social media.</p>
<p>Remove the app from your phone.</p>
<p>Log out from the website on your computer.</p>
<p>Change the password to something you can’t memorize to create an extra barrier to logging in again.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, <strong>this tends to be temporary</strong>. I once removed Twitter from my phone for about 10 days just to recharge. </p>
<p>When it comes to social media, a little break can do a lot of good.</p>
<p>There may be one social media account that&#39;s causing more stress than the others. If a specific app came to mind, delete it for a week. :)</p>
<h4 id="set-a-timer-a-id-timer-">Set a Timer <a id="timer" /></h4>
<p>I don&#39;t have anything insightful to add here.</p>
<p>You know if you need a timer. If you need to use it, use it.</p>
<p>Your health is worth it. I promise.</p>
<h3 id="stop-reading-the-news-a-id-news-">Stop Reading the News <a id="news" /></h3>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong...Please check the news and stay informed. </p>
<p>Just don’t let it consume you. A lot of the news isn’t really news. A lot of it is just noise intended to lay stress on you.</p>
<p>Check the news 1-3 times throughout the day. No more.</p>
<p>The real news doesn’t change often enough to need to check it more than a couple of times. Anything more than this will cause undue stress.</p>
<p><a id="skip-1" /></p>
<p>You don’t need a push notification telling you the latest wild thing said on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>You don’t need a shortcut to your News app, either.</p>
<p>I used to have a shortcut on my phone that allowed me to access my News app quickly and easily. Half of the time, I opened it out of boredom or habit. </p>
<p>There&#39;s a solution for that!</p>
<h3 id="find-fidget-apps-a-id-fidget-">Find &quot;Fidget&quot; Apps <a id="fidget" /></h3>
<p>You’re gonna want to scroll aimlessly on your phone. It’s just a fact of life at this point.</p>
<p>Just be sure to have an app on your phone that you can use to lessen your anxiety instead of worsening it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call them &quot;fidget&quot; apps, because I don&#39;t have any real reason for using them in the moment. Like most times when I use social media, I&#39;m just looking for something to keep my hands occupied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, my fidget app has been a real estate app so I can look at pictures of houses. I also use a bookmarking app that I&#39;ve kinda turned into a vision board.</p>
<p>Whatever it is for you, just have a space where you can be on your phone and you <em>know</em> you won’t be stressed.</p>
<p>Games are a great option! So is reading, as long as the material isn&#39;t depressing.</p>
<h3 id="no-stress-before-or-after-bed-a-id-bed-">No Stress Before Or After Bed <a id="bed" /></h3>
<p>I saved the best for last. Truly.</p>
<p>Stay off of social media and the news for the first hour after you wake up, and at least an hour before bed.</p>
<p>I know reducing screen time before bed is important to help you sleep.</p>
<p><em>(But I also know that I’ll never actually do that.)</em></p>
<p>I at least try to limit myself to apps and websites that will enrich me in some way. This is why it&#39;s so important to have apps that don&#39;t promote doomscrolling.</p>
<p>Personally, I can&#39;t remember the last time I read something on social media that I <em>needed</em> to know immediately. Everything can generally wait until the morning (and after your morning routine).</p>
<p>Doomscrolling is bad at any time. But it&#39;s a horrible way to start the day, and I can&#39;t imagine a worse remedy for sleep.</p>
<p>Give yourself a break. Take some time that&#39;s just for <em>you</em>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-a-id-conclusion-">Conclusion <a id="conclusion" /></h3>
<p>Again, please stay informed. Keep connecting with your loved ones.</p>
<p>Just have balance.</p>
<p>Remember that when you’re on social media, or reading a free news article, <em>you’re</em> the product. It’s their job to ensure that you use their platform as long as possible.</p>
<p>It’s <em>your</em> job to be aware of when you’re being monetized, and to do something about it.</p>
<p>You can stay informed without doomscrolling. I promise.</p>
<p>Please don’t wait until you’re sick with stress.</p>
